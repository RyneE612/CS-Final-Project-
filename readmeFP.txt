Instructions on how to use the gui plot
1) While running the function use make sure to set all of the min and max values for x and y in the top right hand
corner of the plot before putting in the x and y values.
2) The plot allows the user to cahnge the preferred color and type of line that they want to use for the data values 
so make sure to select those before entering in the x and y values. (Min and Max values will be automatically set if
values are not put it the boxes)
3)Now enter in the x and y values for the data, making sure that all of the values fit within the intervals set
by that maximum and minimums for the x and y values. If the a values falls outside of the interval an error message 
will display and keep displaying until the values falls within the interval.
4) if the y and x axis max and mins are set automatically, the plot will auto create to those values, otherwise, it will
set the plot to the specifications set by the user.
5) The final function in the code creates a clear button that allows the user to clear all values that were entered on the graph.
6) When values are entered into the function to create the graph, the numbers need to be entered in as a comma seperated 
list, otherwise the code will not run properly.
